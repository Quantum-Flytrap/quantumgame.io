Underneath there is s real simulator of quantum mechanics - a discrete variant describing polarization and discrete position. You may be not aware of unitary and projective operators, tensor products or complex number - but JavaScript & Rust is doing all the dark magic for you!

- Drag & drop elements to create a quantum experiment.
- Experience a real-time in-browser simulation.
- Interact with up to 3 entangled photons.
- Perform advanced quantum measurements (POVMs).
- See how the entanglement evolves with a visualization (Virtual Lab Only).
- Explore the multiverse tree of all possible outcomes (Virtual Lab Only).
- Check the exact quantum state with a ket visualizer.
- Use either physical elements or abstract qubit gates.
